Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to complete all of the tasks.

I focused of creating a good base for the tasks, so making sure the data is more thoroughly prepared (with duplicates deletion and so on).
I wish I had more time to find a variables that are correlated, as the most straightforward pair (to me) had the correlation almost equal to 0.
